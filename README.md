Recipes project for The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Basics
This project entails creating a simple website with several pages
with instructions for 3 different recipes. It applies what I've learned
about HTML so far, including but not limited to: links, lists, images,
headings, and directory structure.

This project also applies what I learned in Git basics, and I will be 
trying to commit early and often using best practices for writing good
commit messages.
